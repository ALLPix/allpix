Dependencies:

	1) Geant4 must be installed with the following dependencies
	satisfied

	- GDML (xcerces)
	- OpenGL (optional, only needed to use openGL vizualisation)
	- Inventor  (optional, only needed to use the very convenient OpenInventor vizualisation)

	2) ROOT 5.24 or newer (avoid 5.28 for now).  A basic setup is
	enough.

Build:

	Make sure you loaded your Geant4 and ROOT setups (check
	$G4LIB and $ROOTSYS vars for instance). For user installing allpix on lxplus with SLC6, a GEANT4 installation has been prepared for you
	convenience. the bash script setup_allpix.sh need to however edited. in the file, change the folder assigned to G4WORKDIR to a
	folder where you have write access, objects and executable produced during allpix compilation will be put in there. Ex : 
	
		export G4WORKDIR=~/myG4WorkDirectory	
	
	Once the GEANT4 environnement is set, to compile, simply execute : 
		
		make
	



Folder Structure : 

	- include and src : These contain the source code of the allpix framework, whenever you create a new digitizer, the .cc and  .h
	files will be added to these directories 
	
	- macros : This folder contains example of macro files to be used for different type of Simulation framework , see allpix Twiki
	page for more details : https://twiki.cern.ch/twiki/bin/view/Main/AllPix
	
	-models : This folder contains the pixel geometry database (pixeldetector.xml). If one imports geometry from a gdml file, it
	should be put here. (ex : clicpix_box.gdml and clicpic_box_materials.xml)
	
	-share :  This directory contains files and scripts indirectly related to allpix, for example , the python script to translate
	allpix output to slcio file for processing in the EUTELESCOPE framework. See Twiki page for more details https://twiki.cern.ch/twiki/bin/view/Main/AllPix
	
	

Preparing your Simulation : 



	See : https://twiki.cern.ch/twiki/bin/view/Main/AllPix




	
Running:

	Setup your Geant4 and ROOT environments and run the following
	way

	Interactive run:
	  allpix macros/telescope1_vis.in

	Batch run
	  allpix macros/telescope1.in batch
